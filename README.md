# Fancy SAI Editor

Protoype of a visual SmartAI Editor for [TrinityCore](https://www.trinitycore.org/) but with a few changes it can be used with
any other core based on TrinityCore.
The visualisation of the SAI's of multiple NPCs and Gameobject it's very easy to produce good and accurate SAIs.

### It's not fully working so only use it for testing

It's only an prototype and I don't know if I have the time to develope it further but I published this prototype in the hope
that somebody will finish it or at least is inspired by my work to build something which simplifies the writing of good SAI.
